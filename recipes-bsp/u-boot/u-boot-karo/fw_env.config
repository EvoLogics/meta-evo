# Configuration file for fw_(printenv/setenv) utility.
# Up to two entries are valid, in this case the redundant
# environment sector is assumed present.
# Device offset must be prefixed with 0x to be parsed as a hexadecimal value.
# On a block device a negative offset is treated as a backwards offset from the
# end of the device/partition, rather than a forwards offset from the start.

# Note that /dev/mmcblk3boot0 by default is read only
# To use fw_setenv you have to first make it writeable, on the cmdline e.g. by
# $ echo 0 > /sys/block/mmcblk3boot0/force_ro

# Block device name	Device offset	Env. size
/dev/mmcblk3boot0	0xE0000		0x20000
